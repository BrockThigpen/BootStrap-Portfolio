            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... Just kidding!! My name is Brock Thigpen and I want to be a web developer. 
            </p>
            <p>   
                I am originally from Portland, Maine but have been living in Charlotte for about 20 years. I went to Charlotte Catholic High School, and graduated from University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from coding some of my hobbies include playing video games, riding motorcycles, and playing with my german shepherd Rylie.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to start a career in development and continue to grow, but my passion is learning. I take every opportunity I can to learn something new. Whether I am a complete rookie or an extpert on a given subject, I will always try to advance my knowledge and grow as a person in the process.
            </p>
