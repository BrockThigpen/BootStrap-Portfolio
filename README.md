# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio using BootStrap

I created this portfolio to demonstrate my HTML and CSS capabilities. In the future, the gallery will link to completed projects. I also hope to have the contact page functional. Once these features are implemented, I hope to show this portfolio to potenial employers. While creating this project I became even more comfortable writing HTML and CSS. I also learned a lot about Bootstrap, its unique classes, and grid system.
